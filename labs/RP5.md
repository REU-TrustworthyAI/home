## Experiment

- Design your experiment
 - Deliverables: A RP5.pdf file with RP4.pdf + more Experimental Design
   + Performance metrics to evaluate different treatments
   + How will you conduct the experiments? (cross-validation, random repeats, how to split training-testing)
   + Statistical tests to show your approach is better than the baselines
